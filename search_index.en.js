Two broad categories:\n\nType 1: Users get frustrated that certain JavaScript patterns are hard to\nexpress safely in TypeScript. This typically involves runtime reflection,\nwhich I won't discuss today and is usually an issue for less experienced or\nstubborn users (sometimes legitimately!).\nType 2: Users understand TypeScript features in isolation but get confused\ncombining them in seemingly natural ways that don't work as expected. Often\nthis is simply because the feature combination hasn't been implemented.\n\nWe'll focus on a type 2 problem: function overloading and conditional types in\nTypeScript. This is an area many find unsatisfactory and I've seen attempted\ncountless times. The intersection of these features comes up often in the\nTypeScript Discord and at work. The goal is type safety, but the result is\nconfusing compiler errors.\nSome prerequisites\nBefore we jump in, let's have a quick refresher on three TypeScript features:\nunion types, generics, and conditional types. Feel free to skip if you're\nalready familiar with these concepts.\nUnion types\nUnion types in TypeScript allow you to define a type which can be one of several\ntypes.\n\nIn the example above, YanTan is a union type that can either be a string\nliteral type \"tan\" or an object named Yan. The Tethera type is a union of\ntwo different object types, distinguished by their common type property. This\nlatter example is typically called a discriminated union in TypeScript, and\nelsewhere might be called tagged unions, disjoint unions, or sum types.\nTypeScript uses the language's control flow constructs to \"narrow\" union types,\nas demonstrated with the value tethera above.\nFor more on narrowing, the TypeScript handbook chapter on narrowing is a\nmust read for new users:\nGenerics\nGenerics in TypeScript provide a way to define reusable code that can work with\nmultiple types. They allow you to create functions or types that can operate on\nthose different types while preserving type information of the inputs in their\noutputs.\n\nIn this example, the map function takes an array of type T and a callback\nthat maps elements of type T to a different type U. The result is an array\nof type U. This is basically the function signature of Array.prototype.map.\nIn our yan example, we are mapping an array of number and string to an\narray of string, and at each step of the way TypeScript is able to infer the\ntypes of the input and output of the callback function without any additional\ntype annotations.\nConditional Types\nConditional types in TypeScript allow you to create new types based on type\nlevel conditions. They are a powerful way to express complex type relationships\nby giving you a form of control flow in type level expressions of the language.\nAs an ordinary TypeScript user, it is not a feature you will often need to use\nand in fact, you may never have need to use it. However, it is a feature that\npowers a lot of the more clever forms of type inference and type checking that\nyou see in the language and in many popular TypeScript libraries.\n\nIn this example, Yan evaluates to the literal boolean type true because\n123 extends number, and Tan evaluates to false because a string literal\ntype \"1\" does not extend the number literal 1. Numbers are numbers, and\nstrings are not numbers.\n\nP evaluates to false because the object type { bar: string } is not a\nstring. The Printable type is effectively a type level function that takes a\nsingle type as an argument and returns another type. As you can see, this is a\nvery powerful feature and is a large part of why what is often called the \"type\nlevel language\" of TypeScript in many ways effectively its own small functional\nprogramming language.\nEnough about preliminaries, time to get to the meat of the matter.\nTypeScript function overloads are not type safe\nTypeScript supports a form of overloaded functions, which is a common feature in\nmany languages that allows you to implement multiple related functions with a\ncommon name. When you attempt to use that name to call a function, the\nimplementation that gets selected is usually determined by the type and/or arity\n(number) of arguments you provide.\nBefore we look at TypeScript's version of overloading, let's look at a more\nconventional example from Java of an overloaded method called addToken:\n\nThe Java Scanner class has two implementations of addToken; one that takes a\nsingle argument and another that takes two. Depending upon the arity (number of\narguments) and argument types, one of the two implementations is selected. The\nconvenience of this feature is that it groups implementations that conceptually\ndo the same thing, and saves defining separate names like addToken and\naddTokenWithLiteral for all of the possible variants:\nJavaScript does not have function overloads in the sense that Java does, and by\nextension TypeScript also lacks function overloads in the conventional sense. At\nruntime there is no enforcement that functions that take n number of arguments\nmust take n number of arguments - a fact some people unfamiliar with\nJavaScript often find surprising. It is quite common in JavaScript APIs to have\nfunctions that can take a wide variety of types and arity of arguments despite\nthe absence of overloads. So what TypeScript allows for is overloading function\nsignatures, but with a single implementation body:\n\nWith TypeScript function overloads, we define multiple signatures, but only\nimplement a single function that must be compatible with all of the\nnon-implementing signatures. A frustration with this form of overloads is that\nthe type checker only enforces the signature of the implementing function, and\ndoes not enforce that the implementing function satisfies all of the overloads.\nIn short, function overloads are not type safe. They were designed primarily to\nhelp describe existing behavior of JavaScript APIs rather than help you\nimplement new ones.\nFor example, below has an implementing function that will fail to return the\ncorrect value as indicated by the overload signatures. TypeScript will select\nthe second signature overload, but the implementing function will return the\nwrong data type resulting in a runtime type error.\n\nCan we create our own type-safe function overloads?\nTypeScript function overloads are somewhat disappointing because the type\nchecker does not actually check our work. But is it possible to create a\nfunction signature that does check our work? After surveying the features of\nunions and control flow based narrowing, conditional types, and generics, many\nusers of the language construct something along these lines:\nPlayground link\n\nWell this looks very promising! If you inspect the values of stringValue and\nnumberValue we get completely different return types from the same function\ndepending upon the input value, and they all appear to be correct. This looks a\nlot like TypeScript function overloading!\nAs with the previous examples, we have a single implementing function. However,\nthis function takes a single argument T that is a generic with the constraint\nof \"yan\" | \"tan\". That generic value is passed into a type level function\ncalled PrimitiveMap as the return type of the function. This conditional type\nwill pick the appropriately matching return type given the input argument. It\nwould appear that we have successfully recreated TypeScript function overloading\nusing other features of the language.\nThis is the point of frustration for users because when they turn to\nimplementing the function, they find that they cannot implement its body. The\nonly way we could implement the body of getAction is if we assert that the\nreturn value is PrimitiveMap&lt;T&gt;. Asserting this defeats the entire purpose of\nthis exercise, which was to create a type-safe overload.\n\nThe stumbling block here is in the presence of generic types. As of today,\nevaluation of conditional types is deferred until the generic value is resolved,\nwhich only happens when the function is called. The conditional return type of\ngetValueImplementation will only be evaluated when the function is called and\nnot when the function body is being implemented.\nIn TypeScript you cannot evaluate a conditional type level function like\nPrimitiveMap if you give it a generic argument because of this fact. A simple\nillustration of this limitation can be seen below. Despite the fact that T has\na constraint that it extends string, the conditional type remains unevaluated\nwithin the body of the function tan because T is a generic type.\n\nSo what can we do?\nIn both the built-in function overloads and our experimentation with combining\nother language features, we have failed to achieve type-safe overloading\nfunction bodies. While we created nice APIs for consumers, implementers get no\nhelp from the compiler.\nSolution 1: Implement separate functions\nTake a step back. Reconsider the problem the Java case was trying to solve. They\nhad separate implementations with a common name, which isn't a feature of\nJavaScript. As I suggested earlier, the alternative in the Java case is to\nsimply have different names for each implementation. So the solution is staring\nright at us. Have separately named function implementations for each of your\n\"overloads.\"\n\nPrimarily the purpose of TypeScript function overloads is to provide a good\nexperience for users of existing APIs and potentially for library authors. If\nyou are not in one of those categories, then it might be best to avoid the\ncomplexity of trying to implement function overloads in TypeScript and the\ntesting burden it might introduce.\nSolution 2: Sacrifice type safety - for the user's benefit\nIf you are, say, a library author, it might be nice to have overloading function\nsignatures to give your users a pleasant API to use. Here, the advice would be\nto accept that you will have to do extra work to ensure that you are satisfying\noverloaded signatures. This will be in the form of extensive testing. This is a\ncorner of the language where you aren't going to get much compiler help, but it\nmight be a worthwhile sacrifice for your users.\nAdditionally, you could make use of runtime assertions or type guards\nto pass the function arguments to more specialized functions like in solution 1\nexample.\nSo in conclusion, I have only partial solutions to the problem of implementing\ntypesafe function overloads in TypeScript. So yeah... sorry about that! However,\nthe more important point was it's clear to see why someone might think combining\nthese features might work and maybe in future versions of TypeScript it might,\nthough I suspect it might not be a priority and might incur performance or\ncomplexity costs for implementors and users of conditional types.\n","id":"https://m-rutter.com/conditional-types-and-overloading/","title":"Typesafe Function Overloading in TypeScript"},"https://m-rutter.com/projects/":{"body":"","id":"https://m-rutter.com/projects/","title":"projects"},"https://m-rutter.com/risk-of-mastodon-for-journalists/":{"body":"Cathy Newman of Channel 4 News, a UK news broadcaster, asks on Twitter:\n\nOk…Mastodon…erm…which server to use?\n\nThe responses are a combination of mutual confusion and assurances that it does\nnot matter and that she can correct any mistake later. What all of the responses\nfail to mention is that she might not have a choice at all. In at least one\npossible future where some version of the fediverse prevails, her Mastodon\nhandle will be:\ncathy.newman@channel4.com\nThis has potentially major implications for Newman's future relationships with\nboth with her audiences and her employers.\n\nNearly every journalist is invested in what happens to Twitter. It is often\ntheir first port of call when communicating with their audiences - more so than\nthe newspaper, magazine, website, podcast, etc... that they call their employer.\nHaving a large following on Twitter is valuable not only to employers to drive\ntraffic but to journalists as a means of marketing themselves on the jobs\nmarket. From the point of view of an employer, hiring a prominent journalist is\na way of acquiring a new audience. The list of Twitter followers of their new\nhire figures into that hiring decision.\nIt is only natural that in an environment where Twitter's new ownership is\ncausing at least a sense of chaos and raising reasonable questions about its\nfinancial viability that journalists are looking at alternatives such as\nMastodon.\nA key difference between Twitter and Mastodon is that no single entity is\nresponsible for the entire thing. Mastodon is made up of multiple service\nproviders in much the same way that Gmail or Microsoft Outlook provides email\nservices. Or most pertinently, how your employer can provide email services\nunder their own domain. You and your followers can communicate between those\nservices without friction in much the same way as you can email someone at a\ndifferent email domain. It is easy for a business such as a newspaper to manage\nits own Mastodon server.\nOn Mastodon, your followers follow you at your service provider's domain in\nroughly the same way as people subscribe to say an email newsletter. Unlike an\nemail newsletter it is possible for you to easily move to another server and\nhave an automated system update all of your followers to follow you on your new\nservice provider without your followers even noticing it happened, but only if\nthe service provider is cooperative:\n\nMoving your account is the same as redirecting your account, but it will also\nirreversibly force everyone to unfollow your current account and follow your\nnew account, if their software supports the Move activity. Your toots will\nnot be moved, due to technical limitations. There is also a very heavy\ncooldown period in which you cannot migrate again, so be very careful before\nusing this option! - Mastodon - 2022-11-07\n\nLet us imagine a scenario based on real events in the last year. Stephen\nBush is a political editor at the New Statesman. He maintains a daily\nmorning email newsletter that gets sent from his work email account,\nstephen.bush@newstatesman.co.uk. Later, Bush is interviewing for a role as at\nthe Financial Times, a role he desires for the larger dining expense\nbudget. He explains that he could write a newsletter for the FT to help\ndrive subscriptions. While his current employer owns the list of email\nnewsletter subscribers at the New Statesman, he controls a Twitter account,\n@stephenkb, with 140k followers that likely strongly overlaps with both his\ncurrent employer's newsletter and general readership. Stephen argues that he can\ndrive new subscriptions to both the FT and this new newsletter by soliciting his\nfollowers on Twitter. Along with other qualities, Bush secures the job and eats\nwell at St John on Marylebone.\nExcept, Bush does not have a Twitter account, as Twitter collapsed years ago.\nInstead Bush has a Mastodon account that he uses for work,\nstephen.k.bush@newstatesman.com, and which he is obligated to use for work\npurposes. It does not quite have as many followers (roughly 90k) as he keeps\nlosing his followers with the churn of each job. He lost control of his previous\nfollower list at the end of his previous employment.\nWhen Bush interviews for the FT he argues that he could drive more\nsubscriptions, but without being able to credibly say he can solicit all of his\nfollowers at the New Statesman his interviewer finds this argument less\ncredible. Bush ends up staying at the New Statesman and cries into an overcooked\nEnglish Breakfast at a nearby greasy spoon at the next Labour Party conference.\nBush's work Mastodon account is as transferable and under his control as his\nwork email account is - not at all.\nIf something like Mastodon ends up taking the place of Twitter a best case\nscenario for maintaining the status quo is that each journalist self-hosts their\nown server or some independent and reliable operator(s) for journalists arises\nto take Twitter's place. I think an unfortunately more likely future is that\ngiven the opportunity by publishers to take back control over... publishing,\nthey will reach for control as quickly as they can to rein in their employees.\nUpdate 2024-09-24:\nAs a relatively recent adopter of BlueSky I should say that while BlueSky's\nATProto is a fediverse type project the specific problem raised here does not\napply. The way that domain handles work there is that they leverage existing DNS\ninfrastructure to allow users to retain their account but \"borrow\" a domain from\ntheir employer without ceding control. There might still be questions around\naccount portability, but that is certainly no worse than the status quo with\nTwitter/X or existing social media platforms and does not involve employers.\n","id":"https://m-rutter.com/risk-of-mastodon-for-journalists/","title":"Risks of Mastodon for Journalists"}},"docInfo":{"https://m-rutter.com/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://m-rutter.com/about/":{"body":62,"title":0},"https://m-rutter.com/conditional-types-and-overloading/":{"body":966,"title":4},"https://m-rutter.com/projects/":{"body":0,"title":1},"https://m-rutter.com/risk-of-mastodon-for-journalists/":{"body":508,"title":3}},"length":5},"lang":"English"}
