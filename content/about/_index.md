I'm Michael Rutter and this is my half-baked attempt at blogging as though it's
still 2008. I work as a software developer in the UK where I mostly do web
development. I am a self-taught programmer. In a past life I was a philosophy
post-grad specializing in metaphysics.

Topics that I am interested in include programming, philosophy, politics, video
games, and board games.

Programming language-wise, I'm quite interested in languages with interesting
type systems like TypeScript, Rust, and Haskell. For my day job I mostly write
in TypeScript. Philosophy-wise, I was mostly interested in metaphysics and
causation.
